Hi again. My name is Joris van Dijk, this is my website. I am interested in Linux, anything technical be it physical or software. This site is a hobby project where I document my discoveries and technical notes. I like to share what I've learned, and it gives me a convenient place to reference things later. Hopefully it can help someone else too.

At any rate, if you'd like to contact me you can do so via email or on Discord.

- Email: `joris` at this domain
