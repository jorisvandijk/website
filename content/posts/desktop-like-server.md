I just moved my server into my server rack. This sounds silly, but it was a desktop-like enclosure, not a rack mounted one. I do have a rack mount in my basement, but it mainly held switches and the likes. Now it also holds my server and it's amazing. 

The reason for posting this, apart from celebrating the joy of having done this and getting rid of the server sounds in the office, is that I figured there's a tip to be had!

Buy a cheap second monitor, external display thing from Ali. It's one of those tablet-like and tablet-sized things that will act like a secondary monitor on a laptop. Or, a main display in my case. Get this thing and connect it to your rack-mounted server. You now have a display there. Next, grab the USB dongle from your expensive keyboard you always use through Bluetooth or via cable, and whack it in one of the server's USB ports. 

Now, when you have an issue with your server and SSH is failing, you just need to grab that keyboard and wander on to your rack. Switch the slider of your keyboard to USB dongle, turn on the little monitor and you have a desktop PC-like experience on your server.
