I love my new blog website. I like to share useful things I found or did. I prefer to post content that's educational, but not dry. A more personal take-you-by-the-hand-and-pull-you-along kind of educational. I like to think that's pretty much the style I have. There's an issue, though, I also want to yap about other things that may not have any educational value. Just thoughts or experiences or ideas. Straight from my head to this website. 

Now, on one hand, I don't like to _pollute_ the website with content that _has no real value_, but I do feel the need to post more than just tutorials. I am unsure how to go about this. I have tags linked to posts, so I could just mark them "personal" or "rant" or something and push them in between informative posts. This is probably more like a blog is supposed to be. I could also make a second type of post, where I can post semi-short form posts with just personal thoughts, insights or rants. Have this on another part of the site. Maybe a different RSS feed for those who care to read this sort of stuff. Kind of like how [Mijndert](https://mijndertstuij.nl/feeds/) splits posts on his blog between all posts, blog posts, and week notes. Though, that would leave the website with one long list of stuff that may have value to others, and my babbling.

Maybe the real question is, what do I want. Come to think of it, this is _my_ blog. I should just do what I feel fits, the problem, though, is I don't know.

This post in itself is yapping and adds no real value and I am going to post it on the blog and I will add a tag, just to see how it feels. Maybe I even won't scour the web to find a fitting header image for it. Actually, I just decided - I won't. 

If you have thoughts or suggestions, I don't like comment sections, but you can still email me at `joris` at this domain.
