It's been a while since I wrote one, but the other day I finally finished [my tutorial](https://jorisvandijk.com/posts/proxmox-backup-server/) on setting up _Proxmox Backup Server_. It's a detailed account of what I did. I mainly write these to clean up the notes I take while working on things. If I left the notes as-is, in a few months I’d have no idea what I actually did. The notes simply don’t contain everything, so while it's still fresh in my mind, I turn them into a tutorial. I do so mostly for myself, but hopefully its useful to others as well.

Like I said, it’s been a while since I did this, and I forgot how much I enjoy the process! It’s basically going through my notes and recreating whatever I built, while writing down exactly what needs to be done. It takes hours, but for some reason it gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. I enjoyed it so much that I already started another tutorial. :)

I’m not going to say I'll be doing more of these in the coming months, because I rarely stick to promises like that. Instead, I just hope I will.
