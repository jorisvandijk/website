I am debating _slash pages_. This website is a blog, or at least it aims to be. This time around, I didn't just start blogging. No. I also got into reading other people's blogs. I have a [blogroll](/blogroll) page where I list some of the ones I enjoy reading. This particular page, the _blogroll_, is located under my domain, `Jorisvandijk.com`, then a forward slash `/` and then the name `blogroll`. So `https://jorisvandijk.com/blogroll`. Pages like this, pages under the main domain name right after the slash, these are called _slash pages_. At least they are in the [blogosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere) (what a word). 

Anyway, I like clean design and minimalism. A place for everything and everything in its place. Currently the header of this website looks like this: 

![Website header](/img/header.png)

From left to right, the header contains the website URL, a home link, a tags link, a search link, the blogroll link, and a theme toggle. One of these seems out of place to me. The blogroll. Everything there is part of interacting with the website. Blogroll isn't. It does not belong. Hell, I have a [contact page](/joris) which I put in the footer of the site because I felt it does not fit in well up there. Why blogroll then? I put it there because it couldn't go anywhere else, really. [Matt](https://mtwb.blog/blogroll/) first told me about the blogroll and I really like that idea. It reminds me of the _links page_ websites from a better era used to have. A thing my old websites always featured. I feel it's great to link to stuff you like, so people that found and perhaps like your stuff can find stuff you like and in turn may like that. 

Anyway, I believe my website *needs* this page. It has to have a place somewhere. The current location ain't it.

When I learned about the blogroll, I didn't yet know of the concept of slash pages. I found out through several blogs found on the blogosphere. Turns out, there's a huge variety of common slash pages. Ranging from the useful, like a `/about` page, to the macabre with the `/death` page, or the totally pointless, like `/hats`, where one could describe or show all the hats they own. There's so many, that a [website](https://slashpages.net/) exists that lists them. 

So, I already have two of these slash pages for sure. I might as well change the menu item to something like _more_ or _slash_ or even _/_, and have a `/slash` (slash-slash page), where I list all the slash pages I have. I could add to these over time whenever I either find or invent new ones. I think I want to go this route, but I am unsure how to label it in a way that makes sense to both bloggers and non-bloggers, and which pages I should have. I mean, I am not going to make a death page, nor a hat one. I know that much. Fine. I have a single black baseball cap and when I die, I have a will. 

At any rate, do you have thoughts on this? Please feel free to email me your thoughts. The address is on my [/about](/about) page. :)
