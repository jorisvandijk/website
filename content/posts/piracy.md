Now, this kinda sorta makes sense, but also it doesn’t. I’ve been seeing this quote more and more online and it irks me a little. It’s just, well, wrong.

When you pay for Netflix, you take out a subscription. You pay to receive something, and receive it you do. You get access to something. It’s like a newspaper. You subscribe and pay a fee and every morning, a newspaper shows up on your lawn, in your mailbox, or wherever they put it for you. You don’t own the newspaper’s office. Ok, you own the paper you got delivered, but it’s value fades after a day. The news is old and the thing is useless.

How about this then. You pay a subscription for your library pass. This grants you the ability to check out any book you like. Any one. Whichever one you like. You can read that book for as long as you pay for the subscription. You borrow, lend, lease that book. You paid for it in a way, sure. Do you own that book? No. Of course you don’t. It’s the library’s book. You just paid for the honor of getting to read it. You paid for a service, not did not make a purchase.

Then there’s the second part of that quote. No shit digital piracy isn’t stealing. Obviously it is not. When you steal you take something from someone, or somewhere and they do not have it anymore. To them it’s gone. Stolen. They had it. Now they don’t. You didn’t have it. Now you do. Something got taken from one place and was moved, illegally, to somewhere else. This in no way is the same as illegally downloading another copy of something. Nothing was actually taken. Did you gain value? Sure. Did someone else lose value? Well, that’s debatable. On the one hand, if you’re stealing it, you were never going to buy it, so no loss was had. Then again, if there was absolutely no way to steal it, would you have spent the money to get it legally? What I’m saying is there’s no _if_ there. Piracy isn’t stealing, it’s _unauthorized duplication_ or _infringement of intellectual property rights_.

I do get it though. I do. With services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney, Prime and whomever constantly adding and removing content or, what’s worse, content moving from one place to another, this little quote is comforting. They jack up the price again to well over 12 bucks? Hell, I remember paying 3 for a Netflix account. Anyway, counting this as paying for something not worth paying for (as in, I don’t own it, so why am I paying for it), yeah. I get the feeling. Netflix became the solution to digital piracy by offering the stuff people were illegally downloading for an affordable price per month. No more searching for a good file, no more hoping to not get a virus, no more jittery in-cinema filmed copies of a movie. Just pay the fine and see the stuff.

Netflix made sense. Why put in the effort when it was cheap to not? It was even legal, no breaking the law. And for a while that worked. It held true - until it didn’t. More companies got in on the action. Richer ones than Netflix and they could purchase whatever content they wanted to be unique to their service. I think it was The Office. Something that had been on Netflix for some time, but was taken by another service, because they simply could outbid Netflix for the rights. This is the start of the end. Now we have many companies offering part of what we want to see and so, we need to own more than one subscription.

Add to that the fact that prices across services are going up and up and up. I’m pretty sure most of us are paying more for the same content now than we were before the age of streaming services.

No wonder people are once again considering the high seas.

So, to get back to my point. You’re paying to use, not to own. If you don’t want to anymore, you’re doing legally questionable things regarding intellectual property. 

“Leasing isn’t owning, and intellectual property infringement is still a debatable gray area.” Not as sexy, more true.
