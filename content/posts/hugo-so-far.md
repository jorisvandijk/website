As I wrote in my [Hello World](/hello-world) post, I have switched to Hugo. And so far, I am loving it. It's fast, it works great and I have not had to hack together solutions for things I wanted the site to do, but that were not included in the platform _(looking at you, Eleventy!)_. I like how the back-end of it works and I like the way you make new posts, or run the site locally for testing. I like how you can use a pre-built theme, but then override it so you can make it your own, without having to touch the actual theme files - this makes updating the theme later on possible as well. I like that I can host it on a git provider wich offers a _pages_ functionality.
