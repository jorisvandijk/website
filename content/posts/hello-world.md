And once again a new *Hello World* post is born. This is the umpteenth iteration of this website, as I cannot seem to stop wanting to change things up. I like trying out new ideas. Sometimes they lead somewhere, mostly they don't. 

The last version of this site placed the content into a more documentation-like website format. I thought I'd like that more than a blog — mainly for organizational purposes. A bit more structured than the *throw it at a wall and see what sticks* blog approach.

Turns out, I hate structure. I also didn't like the look of the site at all. So as with many before it, it got nuked. 

So, now we're here. After running everything from *Drupal*, *WordPress*, plain HTML, *Eleventy*, *Docusaurus*, and who-can-remember what else, we're on *Hugo* now. The reasoning behind this is simple: I've never tried it before. It looks good and seems to have all the functionality I would require from a blog platform, like writing in *Markdown*, building on *GitHub Pages*, good theming possibilities, no dependencies and fast build times. I've even got a self-reliant search function.

Working on the layout, looks and functionality of the Hugo site has been a blast. I really enjoy this part of the development of a website—probably more so than the actual blogging on the end result. Anyway, I've stuck to the *Everforest* theme and I've even included a light version for those who like that sort of thing. The font I am using right now is called *Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font*. I like the look of the font in my terminal, but am not totally sold on it as a website font yet.

So. Here we are. A new website which will need to be filled again. What's the plan? Well, I suppose I'll be bringing back old content to the site, as that still has value. I will be rewriting and updating it as I get through it, though. Apart from that, after 12+ years I've switched from *Arch Linux* to *NixOS*, which has forced me to learn and discover new things. I've gotten more into cybersecurity due to school and I've been improving my homelab. I'll probably also pepper in the occasional personal post, thought or babble — we'll see.

For now, welcome to my new website.
