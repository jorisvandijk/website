Thank you for taking an interest in helping make this site better, I really appreciate any feedback or contributions you might have.

# Found Something Wrong?
If you spot any issues while reading through the posts or pages here, I'd love to hear about it. Whether it's a typo that slipped through, a factual error I missed, a broken link, or just something that doesn't quite make sense, please let me know.

You can report issues through whichever Git platform you prefer:

- GitHub: https://github.com/jorisvandijk/website/issues/new
- GitLab: https://gitlab.com/jorisvandijk/website/-/issues/new
- Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/jorisvandijk/website/issues/new

Don't worry about being too formal when reporting something - just tell me what you found and where you found it. Even a quick "hey, there's a typo in paragraph 3 of your post about X" is incredibly helpful.

# Questions?
If you have questions about any of the content on the site, want clarification on something I've written, or are curious about my thoughts on a particular topic, feel free to reach out via email or on Discord. Contact information can be found on the [here](/joris/).

# Guest Posts
I'm always interested in guest posts from people who have something interesting to share. If you've got expertise in a topic that would fit well on the site, or if you've got a unique perspective on something I've written about, I'd love to hear from you.

The topics should generally align with what I usually write about here, but I'm pretty open to related areas. To pitch a guest post or submit something you've already written, just email me or reach out on Discord. Contact information can be found [here](/joris/). I'd prefer to see at least a brief outline or summary of what you're thinking before you spend time writing a full piece, just so we can make sure it's a good fit.
