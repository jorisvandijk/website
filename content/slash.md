> Slash pages are common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like _/now_, _/about_, or _/uses_. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.

That was stolen from [SlashPages.net](https://slashpages.net/), but it captures the idea well. The following are my slash pages:

- [/blogroll](/blogroll): These are all the blogs I follow and think anyone else should too.
- [/about](/about): This is my about page as well as my contact page.
- []()
